This plugin was developed by Hugo Potier https://community.projectredcap.org/articles/7843/export-participants-images-qr-code-files.html

It only worked with REDCap version <= 9.8.0

Hugo made changes for it work with version > 9.8.0

I updated the code to make it work with version less than, equal to or greater than version 9.8.0
